Make Me A Video Game!

I the tired and sick Omar have ended ahmad's bad sister and plan to steal her lovely face!

What are a whale and backpacking cat to do? Before you can help laila, you'll have to collect the old key and the great sword excalibar that open up the 7 worlds connected to A giant dragon's Lair. There are 16 gems and 15 space marines in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
